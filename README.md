# Caution

<h2>**DO NOT INSTALL THIS ON PS TV**</h2>

Adjustments are still needed to install on PS TV.

**Currently the application only works with 3.60**

If CEX2DEX is restarted on the "loading kernel helper" many times, the required ones are not installed.

Note that this makes a permanent change to the device.

Also keep in mind that these have been thoroughly tested but can cause irreparable damage to your device.
